# Dexter HDI
This is a development / beta branch. Please do NOT use these files unless you are very aware of how Dexter works. For existing / prior versions see the [Dexter 1](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/tree/master) branch or the [Dexter HD/HDI](https://github.com/HaddingtonDynamics/Dexter/tree/Stable_2020_02_04_ConeDrive) branch. Please note that many files are not yet released for the Dexter HDI robot and if you have purchased the robot, you should use the private documents we've sent you rather than these GitHub repos, except for the wiki documentation, which should cover all models.
